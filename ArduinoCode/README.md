# Arduino Code

Only the GPS_Clock code is working.

## GPS Clock

This is the code to get the time from the GPS module. It works, kind of, if
you're outside and have the luck of the Irish leprechauns on your side.

## Basic Clock

A very brief attempt to just have the time displayed programmatically. You'd
have to turn the watch on at the same time the program is designed to start,
though. Not a great idea...


## flashlight

A quick attempt to sketch out what would be required to make a button press
change the watch into a flashlight.
